# CHANGELOG

All changes to this project are reported here. The versioning system is of semantic type (x.y.z) and the changes are reported for every release. Releases are sorted by date, with the latest release on top. Versions where the major release (x) is 0 is considered an alpha release and probably has numerous bugs. Versions that indicate a stable release have an ending L letter at the end of the version, for example (0.0.1L or 1.2.10L). A stable release is a release that passed all expected verifications and tests. Each release includes a brief description of the changes it brings, as well as a list of changes, additions and removals.
